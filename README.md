# Genome-Sequencing---GUTS-Hackathon-2016
Full genome sequencer from a set of partitions generated by splitting it on different substrings.
Challenge repository embedded in this one under AlienDNAChallenge.
Only slightly reformatted after original Hackathon; might finish it in the future.

# Current Status
1k and 10k genomes are sequenced with both res and resF.
res and resF do not complete 100k and disagree on their partial solutions; res is more trustworthy
