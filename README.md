# Genome-Sequencing---GUTS-Hackathon-2016
Full genome sequencer from a set of partitions generated by splitting it on different substrings.
Challenge repository embedded in this one under AlienDNAChallenge.
Only slightly reformatted after original Hackathon; might finish it in the future.

# Current Status
The line 84 command using alignAndJoinWithOverlapFast sequences the 1k and 10k genomes fully and the others partially.
The line 85 command using alignAndJoinDeterministic holds more promise but has some bug and therefore only partially sequences all genomes.
